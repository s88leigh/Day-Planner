# Day Planner

AS AN employee with a busy schedule

I WANT to add important events to a daily planner

SO THAT I can manage my time effectively 

Create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. 
The app should display standard business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.).
Near the top of the calendar, the application should display the current day.
Clicking on the save button will store the time and user input in `localStorage`.
